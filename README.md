The incessant changes in the software requirements, the continuous shrinks in schedule and resources have driven the rise of state-of-the-art processes that would eventually 
simplify the development and delivery of software. We mean by these procedures the set of universal repeatable solutions followed either to overcome certain puzzling topics 
in the field of software engineering, or to ease the overall process of developing business applications. Among these practices, we state agile methodologies, that came as 
a solution to the inflexible and volatile environment of certain businesses, software design patterns which arose as a set of solutions to recurring challenges in a given 
software context, or software testing where a developed system is ensured to be bug free and adheres to the initial requirements. The latter, as a matter of fact, is one of 
the major activities in a software development life cycle. The research suggests performing testing related activities requires almost 30\% of the overall software developmentâ€™s 
effort [4]. Besides running test scripts and reporting results to the developers, a software tester has to generate test case values: the required input values to complete the 
execution of a System Under Test (SUT) [1]. The main objective of this thesis remains to design and develop a web-based application allowing the generation of random and
independent test case inputs. The suggested solution offers the software tester the ability to specify a set of parameters that the generated inputs would have to respect, 
mainly the data type of inputs: be it JSON files, CSV files, or simply strings, number of elements to generate, the vocabulary to use, plus a possibility to use a BNF 
notation to specify the grammar to be followed. Additionally, the tool can be accessed either by a friendly user interface, or through an Application Programming Interface (API).
