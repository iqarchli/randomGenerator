# randomGenerator
The main objective of this project is to design and develop a web-based application allowing the generation of random and independent test case inputs. The suggested solution offers the software tester the ability to specify a set of parameters that the generated inputs would have to respect,  mainly the data type of inputs: be it JSON files, CSV files, or simply strings, number of elements to generate, the vocabulary to use, plus a possibility to use a BNF notation to specify the grammar to be followed. Additionally, the tool can be accessed either by a friendly user interface, or through an Application Programming Interface (API).
